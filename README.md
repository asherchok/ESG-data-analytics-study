## Motivation

There is a need to understand the scale at which companies are contributing to climate change and hold them accountable for their actions. This data analysis on carbon emissions from companies aims to identify and quantify the emissions being emitted by each company, with the goal of motivating them to reduce their CO2 emissions. The information gathered from this analysis can also be used to inform investors on the environmental impact of the companies they are investing in and provide them with the tools they need to make more responsible investment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this analysis is to drive positive change and help combat the devastating effects of climate change.
